        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p><strong>Response:</strong> I hope to have a pretty good grasp of how websites work in order to help me design my own site more professionally. I guess I'd like to know how to create buttons and a nice looking drop-down menu. I do like <a href="https://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a>. They've done a fantastic job making their interface intuitive. Websites like Amazon are bogged down with too much information, which makes it impossible for the average person to utilize their site properly without just using the search bar. Hulu uses concise menus to let you find what you're looking for without sifting through a massive amount of unnecessary info.</p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p><strong>Response:</strong> I am planning on doing project 1 based on Marvel's Spiderverse. I'd showcase the heroes, the villains, and additional characters as they're portrayed in different mediums (film, coimcs, and videogames). I would keep the design cohesive by having elements such as chat bubbles for buttons, the sound of Spider-Man's web being shot when you click a button, Spider-Man's symbol as the logo at the top-left to take you back to the homepage, and the layout of each page would be consistent. The pages will use different colors that represent the different characters (red and blue for Peter Park, green and orange for Green Goblin, red and black for Miles Morales, etc.). My imagery, color palette, and typography will display a knowledge of the characters and make it immediately obvious whose page you are on before you even read the body text by matching up with the characters themselves.</p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.</p>
        <p><strong>Response:</strong> I imagine that the person using my website would be new to Marvel. All that they know about Spider-Man comes from his original trilogy from the early 2000's. They read how similar some of the circumstances are for the other characters in the Spider-Verse, and they want to learn more about them. They start to watch their movies, and then they move onto their comics, cartoons, and video games. They become such a big fan that they decide to share my website with other people to jumpstart their interest in these characters, so they can have this shared love for everything Spider-Verse.</p>
