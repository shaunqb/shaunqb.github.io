        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p><strong>Response:</strong> I hope to have a pretty good grasp of how websites work in order to help me design my own site more professionally. I guess I'd like to know how to create buttons and a nice looking drop-down menu. I do like <a href="https://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a>. They've done a fantastic job making their interface intuitive. Websites like Amazon are bogged down with too much information, which makes it impossible for the average person to utilize their site properly without just using the search bar. Hulu uses concise menus to let you find what you're looking for without sifting through a massive amount of unnecessary info.</p>
