            <p>EDDIE BROCK MADE HIS DEBUT AS VENOM IN “THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN” #299 IN APRIL, 1988. VENOM AND EDDIE BOTH DESPISED PETER PARKER. EDDIE WAS A JOURNALIST WHO WROTE A HUGE STORY, ABOUT AN INTERVIEW WITH A SUPERVILLAIN, THAT WAS DISCREDITED BY SPIDER-MAN APPREHENDING THE REAL VILLAIN. THE SYMBIOTE, “VENOM”, HATED PETER FOR RIPPING HIM OFF OF HIS BODY AND GETTING RID OF THE SYMBIOTE WHEN HE FOUND OUT IT WAS A LIVING BEING THAT WAS TRYING TO BOND WITH HIM.</p>
            <p>EDDIE HAS GAINED MANY POWERS FROM BONDING WITH THE SYMBIOTE KNOWN AS VENOM. TOGETHER, THEY CAN USE EVERY POWER THAT SPIDER-MAN CAN, MINUS HIS SPIDER-SENSE. INSTEAD OF HAVING HIS SPIDER-SENSE, HE CAN NEGATE SPIDER-MAN’S SPIDER-SENSE AND ATTACK PETER WITHOUT TRIGGERING IT. HE HAS MANY POWERS BEYOND THAT, SUCH AS INVISIBILITY, SHAPESHIFTING, AND THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE HIS OWN WEBBING.</p>
            <p>EDDIE WAS ORIGINALLY MISTAKEN AS A VILLAIN BECAUSE OF HIS DESIRE FOR REVENGE ON SPIDER-MAN. HOWEVER, OVER TIME, VENOM SHOWED THAT HE WANTS TO PROTECT EVERYONE WHO IS INNOCENT. THIS DESIRE CAUSES HIM INTENSE GUILT EVERY TIME THAT THE SUPERVILLAIN KNOWN AS CARNAGE MURDERS SOMEONE SINCE HIS SYMBIOTE SPAWNED FROM VENOM, THUS MAKING HIM FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR DEATHS.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH HE’S NOT AS POPULAR AS SPIDER-MAN, VENOM HAS BEEN WELL-KNOWN SINCE HIS DEBUT. HE’S BEEN SHOWN IN VIDEO GAMES, CARTOONS, MANY COMICS (INCLUDING HIS OWN SERIES), AND EVEN LANDED HIS OWN MOVIE IN 2018.</p>
