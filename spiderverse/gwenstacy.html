            <p>THE MAIN MARVEL UNIVERSE’S GWEN STACY WAS PETER PARKER’S FIRST REAL LOVE. SHE DIED AFTER PETER PARKER FAILED TO SAVE HER FROM THE GREEN GOBLIN. HOWEVER, THE GWEN STACY NOW KNOWN AS GHOST-SPIDER COMES FROM AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE WHERE SHE WAS BITTEN BY A GENETICALLY-ENGINEERED SPIDER AND GAINED THE SAME POWERS AS THE MAIN UNIVERSE’S SPIDER-MAN. INITIALLY, GWEN FOCUSED ON MAINTAINING HER NEWFOUND POPULARITY AS “SPIDER-WOMAN”, BUT SHE BECAME A HERO AFTER HER FATHER TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH GOOD SPIDER-WOMAN COULD BE DOING. HER UNIVERSE’S PETER PARKER IDOLIZED SPIDER-WOMAN AND ACCIDENTALLY TURNED HIMSELF INTO “THE LIZARD” IN AN ATTEMPT TO GIVE HIMSELF POWERS LIKE HER. HE RAMPAGED AND GWEN CAME TO STOP HIM. DESPITE HIS PLEAS TO QUIT FIGHTING, SHE CONTINUED TO FIERCELY FIGHT HIM. THE EXTENSIVE DAMAGE PETER TOOK FROM HIS FIGHT WITH GWEN KILLED HIM AFTER HE RETURNED TO NORMAL. SHE SWORE TO NEVER FAIL ANYONE AGAIN AND PUSHED HARDER THAN EVER BEFORE TO PROTECT ALL OF THE CITIZENS OF NEW YORK.</p>
            <p>GHOST-SPIDER’S SEPTEMBER 2014 DEBUT IN “EDGE OF SPIDER-VERSE” #2 HASN’T STOPPED HER FROM BECOMING ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN SPIDER-VERSE CHARACTERS. SHE’S BEEN PORTRAYED IN SEVERAL COMICS, TV SHOWS, VIDEO GAMES, AND GAINED FURTHER POPULARITY IN 2018’S “INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE”.</p>
            <p>SHE’S BEEN KNOWN AS SPIDER-WOMAN, SPIDER-GWEN, AND IS CURRENTLY CALLED GHOST-SPIDER. HER UNIQUE COLOR PALETTE AND HOOD (ATTACHED TO HER SUIT) HELP HER STAND OUT COMPARED TO THE OTHER, SIMILARLY DRESSED SPIDER-PEOPLE.</p>
