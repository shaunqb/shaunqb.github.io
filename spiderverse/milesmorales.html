            <p>MILES MORALES FIRST APPEARED IN 2011’S “ULTIMATE FALLOUT” #4. MILES DOESN’T COME FROM THE MAIN MARVEL COMIC UNIVERSE. IN HIS UNIVERSE, HE HAD BEEN BITTEN BY A SPIDER THAT HIS UNCLE HAD STOLEN FROM NORMAN OSBORN. IT GAVE HIM POWERS SIMILAR TO SPIDER-MAN (PETER PARKER), AS WELL AS A STUN BLAST AND A CAMOUFLAGE ABILITY. UNLIKE PETER PARKER, HE DIDN’T WANT TO BE A SUPERHERO. HE WANTED TO BE A REGULAR TEEN. A FEW MONTHS LATER, THIS DESIRE TO REMAIN NORMAL CAUSED HIM TO BE LATE GETTING TO THE SCENE WHERE SPIDER-MAN DIED SAVING HIS FAMILY. JUST LIKE PETER PARKER, HE LEARNED THE HARD WAY THAT “WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBLITY”.</p>
            <p>HE’S GAINED POPULARITY SINCE HIS DEBUT. HE IMMEDIATELY RECEIVED HIS OWN SERIES, AND HE WAS QUICKLY INTRODUCED INTO VIDEO GAMES AND CARTOONS. MOST PEOPLE KNOW HIM FROM 2018’S “INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE” WHICH WAS A RETELLING OF HIS ORIGIN THAT INTRODUCED HIM TO SEVERAL OTHER UNIVERSES’ SPIDER-PEOPLE. A COUPLE MONTHS BEFORE THE MOVIE HIT THEATERS, FANS WERE ABLE TO SEE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ORIGIN TOLD IN “SPIDER-MAN” FOR THE PLAYSTATION 4. MILES IS GETTING HIS OWN SPIN-OFF/SEQUEL TO THIS GAME WHEN THE PLAYSTATION 5 COMES OUT IN NOVEMBER, 2020.</p>
            <p>HIS ORIGIN ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO GREW UP WITH PETER PARKER’S DEBUT TO CONNECT WITH NEW, YOUNG FANS OF MILES MORALES IN A WAY THAT OTHER MARVEL CHARACTER CAN’T. THE MCU ALREADY STARTED TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS POPULARITY WITH 2017’s “SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING” WITH AN EASTER EGG WHERE HIS UNCLE MENTIONS HIM.</p>
